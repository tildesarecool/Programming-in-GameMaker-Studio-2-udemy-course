# Programming in GameMaker Studio 2 udemy course
I'm starting my udemy course on GMS

Fresh off my 4 part course in creating the "Fire Jump" game using the DnD system of GMS2 (which is free on youtube), I'm following my GMS2 udemy course I paid for and that covers the GML scripting language.

The Udemy course is at

I managed to finish the whole thing. I mean it was only two hours but I finished it. It's simutaniously very basic but also quick paced and a few things are glossed over. But it does make me want to use GML that much more versus DND in GMS2 so there's that.
